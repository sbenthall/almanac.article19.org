    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>This study group develops standards for various stages of the
        broadcasting chain, from the production of programs to how they are
        delivered to the audience. This includes discussions around spectrum
        allocation and quality of service for broadcasting. Spectrum
        allocations set in this group determine which services have access in
        order to broadcast information. This ultimately impacts media plurality
        among broadcasting services and the choice people have when consuming
        media and information.
