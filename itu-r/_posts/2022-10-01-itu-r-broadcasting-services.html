    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>SG6 develops standards for various stages of the broadcasting chain,
        from the production of programs to how they are delivered to the
        audience. Elements of this work includes spectrum allocation and
        quality of service for broadcasting. Spectrum allocations set in this
        group determine which services have access to spectrum to be able to
        broadcast information. This ultimately impacts media plurality among
        broadcasting services and the choices that people have when consuming
        media and information.</p>
