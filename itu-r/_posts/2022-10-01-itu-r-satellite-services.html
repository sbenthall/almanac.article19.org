    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>SG4 develops standards for satellite service systems and networks
        for various uses, including mobile and broadcasting satellites. The
        study group also sets out spectrum allocations for satellite services
        and, in turn, determines which satellite operators can provide
        telecommunication services for users. This ultimately affects how
        people access information and communicate with each other, particularly
        as satellite communications can be used to provide affordable
        connectivity in specific cases to users in rural communities.</p>
