    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>The study group develops standards for satellite service systems and networks for various uses, including mobile and broadcasting satellites. The group also sets out spectrum allocations for satellite services and in turn, determines which operators using satellite services can provide telecommunication services for users. This ultimately affects how people access information and communicate with each other.</p>
