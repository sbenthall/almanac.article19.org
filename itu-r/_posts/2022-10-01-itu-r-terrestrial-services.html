    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>This group develops standards for fixed, mobile, radio determined, and amateur-satellite services. The universal use of mobile communications and wireless communications is reliant on access to spectrum in order to connect users to the internet. The Working Party 5D (WP 5D) within SG 5 specifically develops standards for overall radio system aspects of International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) systems. The allocation of spectrum determines who has the ability to deploy networks and provide communities with internet access.
