    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>SG5 develops standards for fixed, mobile, radio-determined, and
        amateur-satellite services. The universal use of mobile communications
        and wireless communications is reliant on access to spectrum in order
        to connect users to the internet. Working Party 5D (WP 5D) within SG5
        specifically develops standards for overall radio system aspects of
        International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) systems. The allocation
        of spectrum determines who has the ability to deploy networks and
        provide communities with internet access.</p>
