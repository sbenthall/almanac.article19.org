<p>The dashboard shows detailed data about the dominant actors in either a specific working group or a broader view from select working groups within a standards developing organisation. If that's a little too detailed, start by <a href="{{ site.url }}/dom-overview.html">getting an animated overview of our findings</a> or <a href="{{ site.url }}/dom-about.html">learn more about our research and how to use the dashboard</a> first.</p>
