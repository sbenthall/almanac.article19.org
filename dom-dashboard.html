<p>The data dashboard shows detailed data about dominant actors in either a working group or an entire SDO. If that's a little too detailed, start by getting an <a href="{{ site.url }}/dom-overview.html">animated overview of our findings</a> or learn more about <a href="{{ site.url }}/dom-about.html">our research</a> and how to use the dashboard first.</p>
