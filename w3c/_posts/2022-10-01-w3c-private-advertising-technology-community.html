        <p>This group aims to develop web features and APIs that support
        advertising while also safeguarding user privacy. Advertisers and
        publishers can measure how effective their ads are by determining
        whether a user clicks on an ad and ends up purchasing a product shown
        through the advertiser’s cookie. This can allow advertisers to track
        users across the internet based on websites where their ads have been
        placed.</p>

        <li><b>Current proposals:</b> <a href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/ipa">Interoperable Private Attribution (IPA)</a> aims to stop linking users through cookies by developing linkages based on an anonymous identifier. This could prevent users’ browsing behaviour from being tracked while measuring the effectiveness of online ads.</li>
