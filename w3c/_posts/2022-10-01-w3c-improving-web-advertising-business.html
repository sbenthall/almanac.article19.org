        <p>This group acts as a forum for stakeholders to identify where online
        advertising can be more effective and secure. Online advertising models
        have often led to increased tracking of user behaviour and browsing
        patterns and identifying individuals based on this information. The
        group serves to identify and incubate privacy-preserving models of
        advertising rather than develop standards themselves. While the group
        does not look at technical proposals anymore, it is primarily a place
        for the discussion of topics and gathering use cases and requirements
        before proposals are developed in Community Groups and Working
        Groups.</p>
