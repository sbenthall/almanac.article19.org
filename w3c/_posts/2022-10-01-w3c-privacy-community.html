        <p>The Privacy Community Group aims to develop web features and APIs
        that improve user privacy through browser enhancements. These features
        primarily occur in the form of how cookies and browsing information is
        stored and shared. Security vulnerabilities can allow malicious actors
        to obtain a user's session cookies to impersonate the user, perform
        actions on behalf of the user and gain access to sensitive
        information.</p>
