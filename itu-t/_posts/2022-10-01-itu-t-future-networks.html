    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>SG13 develops standards for cloud computing, 5G mobile
        communications, and quantum key distribution networks. It also
        addresses the requirements, architectures, functional capabilities, and
        application programming for <a
        href="https://www.itu.int/en/publications/ITU-T/pages/publications.aspx?parent=T-HDB-PLN.03-2012&media=electronic">future
        networks</a>. SG13 has also been setting standards for network aspects of
        the Internet of Things (IoT) and the application of artificial intelligence
        (AI) and machine learning for communication networks such as 5G. Data intensive
        technologies such as AI can extract or infer sensitive data about users, from
        their biometric information to their behaviours. As such, they can normalise
        mass surveillance, tracking, and profiling of individuals in both online and
        offline spaces, affecting how people will exercise their rights to privacy and
        freedom of expression.</p>
        <p>
        Under the direction of SG13, the <a
        href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/net2030/Pages/default.aspx">Focus
        Group on Technologies for Network 2030 (FG NET-2030)</a> is tasked to study
        the architecture, requirements, use cases, and capabilities of the “New IP” and
        similar proposals. The elements proposed in the “New IP” model may undermine
        the interoperability, security, and governance of existing IP-based networks.
