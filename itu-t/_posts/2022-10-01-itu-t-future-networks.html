        <p>This study group develops standards for cloud computing, 5G mobile communications, and quantum key distribution networks, as well as addressing the requirements, architectures, functional capabilities and application programming for <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/publications/ITU-T/pages/publications.aspx?parent=T-HDB-PLN.03-2012&media=electronic" class="glossary">future networks</a>. The SG has also been setting standards for network aspects of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the application of AI and machine learning for communication networks such as 5G. As some of these technologies become more ubiquitous, the collection of sensitive and personally identifiable data, as well as the security of that data, becomes more important.</p>
