    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>SG20 develops technical standards that delineate architectures,
        reference models, requirements, and capabilities for Internet of Things
        (IoT) and systems and services for smart cities and communities. With
        more countries deploying infrastructure in the name of “smart” spaces,
        from shopping centres to workplaces, the extensive data being collected
        by sensor technologies embedded in these spaces normalises and
        facilitates mass surveillance of people’s behaviour and movement.</p>

        sets out the requirements, capabilities, and architecture for smart
        education services, with the intention to improve and enhance learning
        and teaching efficiency in schools. The proposal includes methods for
