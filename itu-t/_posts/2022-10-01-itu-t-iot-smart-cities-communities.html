        <p>This study group develops technical standards that delineate
        architectures, reference models, requirements, and capabilities for
        Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities and communities systems and
        services. With more countries deploying infrastructure in the name of
        “smart” spaces, from shopping centres to workplaces, the extensive data
        being collected by sensor technologies normalises mass surveillance in
        these spaces, which can be used to monitor individual behaviour and
        movement.  </p>

         and Reference Architecture of Smart Education</a> sets up the
        requirements, capabilities and architecture for smart education with
        the intention to improve and enhance learning and teaching efficiency
        in schools. The proposal includes methods for video monitoring and
        surveillance of the school environment and monitoring students’ behaviours
        and emotions. The highly invasive technology used for smart education presents
        issues of how this technology is deployed and the consent of the individuals,
        especially minors.</li>
