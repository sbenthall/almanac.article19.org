        <p>This study group develops standards that address security aspects of
        telecommunication/ICT and applications, including the Internet of
        Things (IoT), smartphones, web services, 5G, and technologies being
        studied and standardised in other study groups across <a href="{{ site.url }}/orgs/6_itu-t.html" rel="nofollow">ITU-T</a>. As
        individuals interact with ICT applications in their everyday lives, an
        increasingly large amount of personal information and data that can be
        used to identify and track people is collected.
