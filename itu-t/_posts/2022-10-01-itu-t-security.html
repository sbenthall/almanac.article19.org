        <p>SG17 develops standards that address security aspects of
        telecommunications, ICTs, and related applications being studied and
        standardised in other study groups across <a href="{{ site.url }}/orgs/6_itu-t.html">ITU-T</a>. Security principles,
        including confidentiality, integrity, and availability, are important
        determinants in how well technologies and systems protect or threaten
