    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>SG16 develops standards for multimedia applications and services for
        existing and future networks. It includes coding standards for image,
        audio, and video formats, such as JPEG. It also develops standards for
        video surveillance, including how individuals and objects are
        identified through surveillance hardware and software. In recent years,
        there have been proposals to build on this video surveillance work by
        introducing capabilities or requirements related to face, behaviour,
        and emotion recognition. These biometric technologies can further
        threaten peopleâ€™s privacy and freedom of expression by enabling
        constant tracking and profiling of individuals.</p>
