* make plotly library lighter
  https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CUSTOM_BUNDLE.md
* error handling on d3js: if file exists
* load the polyfill only in incompatible browsers?
* check out how to layout on mobile (some renderings may be too large) in portrait mode)
  - possibility: export everygthing as PNG and have mobile use these images instead
  - might require manual work
* check how to configure the plotly actions on top right (called modebar)
  - https://plotly.com/javascript/configuration-options/
  - eg. export SVG instead of PNG
  - remove some buttons â†’ var config.

* maybe have only one page in jekyll that calls everything dynamically
  according to a param in the URL. might need to use some yaml for that as some
  kind of DB
  - https://plotly.com/javascript/dropdowns/ that could be useful to load even the data dynamically
  - https://plotly.com/javascript/custom-buttons/
  * images
  * names
  * data

* have a page where catnip explains how this works
* maybe don't use the titles in the SVG, but have them in HTML and then have a catnip icon

- do we need animations?

@Seb

- influence
  - order csv headers alphabetically *after* the affiliations have been added
  - it's not easy to match an affiliation to a person who has had multiple
    affiliations. we'd need to create a separate column for each affiliation of
    the person rather than for the person. not sure how to deal with this.

- authorship
  - order alphabetically by affiliation *after* the info is there
  - in the CSV file, the header was written on the bottom instead of at the top

- leadership
  - order alphabetically by affiliation *after* the info is there or keep current order by date?
  - datetime_min must not be empty
  - datetime_max must not be empty, set to current date?
  - datetime_min and datetime_max must not be equal

- affiliations
  - normalize names and automate that

- names
  - must never be empty
  - decode utf-8 strings correctly
  - remove double quotes in names and emails

- visualization
  - do we want to export PNG or SVG (scalable but not for everyone)
  - maybe we can do both
