* error handling on d3js: if file exists
* load the polyfill only in incompatible browsers?
* check out how to layout on mobile (some renderings may be too large) in portrait mode)
  - possibility: export everygthing as PNG and have mobile use these images instead
  - might require manual work
* check how to configure the plotly actions on top right (called modebar)
  - https://plotly.com/javascript/configuration-options/
  - eg. export SVG instead of PNG
  - remove some buttons â†’ var config.

* maybe have only one page in jekyll that calls everything dynamically
  according to a param in the URL. might need to use some yaml for that as some
  kind of DB
  - https://plotly.com/javascript/dropdowns/ that could be useful to load even the data dynamically
  - https://plotly.com/javascript/custom-buttons/
  * images
  * names
  * data

* have a page where catnip explains how this works
* maybe don't use the titles in the SVG, but have them in HTML and then have a catnip icon

- do we need animations?
