    <h2 class="title">How this came about</h2>
    <p>This almanac is a reflection of the work and knowledge of the community of
    public interest technologists, human rights defenders, and civil society
    advocates who are already engaged in the internet standards' space. In early
    2022, we surveyed various networks, organisations, and individuals who engage
    in global and regional technical standards development organisations (also
    known as by the acronym SDO). We asked them to identify key activities
    occurring in these SDOs that would have implications for human rights. We
    received 18 responses, which we used to build a map of the relevant working
    groups, study groups, and committees within each SDO. We then conducted desk
    research and analysis to further detail these standardisation activities and
    organise them in two ways: by technical issue and by human rights issue. We
    then submitted a draft of the almanac to a series of external technical reviews
    and beta testing before releasing it into the world.</p>

    <h3 class="title">There’s a lot about the&nbsp;IETF</h3>
    <p>You might have noticed this, because we certainly did. The almanac has
    information about more standardisation activities happening in the Internet
    Engineering Task Force (IETF) than in any other SDO. That’s simply because
    a majority of the survey respondents identified crucial work being done in
    the IETF. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the IETF is the most important
    SDO. We’ve found that some SDOs are more transparent and open to the
    community than others. That’s the case of the IETF, hence the bias of
    information. Our hope is that, as this almanac grows and supports the
    community’s engagement in more SDOs, we can keep building a more complete
    picture of the standards landscape.</p>

    <h3 class="title">Where’s ICANN?</h3>
    <p>Important question, thanks for asking! We decided to focus on technical
    Internet-related standards rather than the much broader and complex world
    of technical Internet policy. Nevertheless, ICANN’s technical policies are
    really important, as they impact the operations of the Domain Name System,
    and we encourage you to find out more about it <a href="https://www.icann.org/">here</a>.</p>
