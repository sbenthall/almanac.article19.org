x make plotly library lighter
  https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CUSTOM_BUNDLE.md

  `mkdir bundle
   npm i plotly.js
   cd node_modules/plotly.js
   npm i
   npm run custom-bundle -- --out almanac-bundle --traces scatter --transforms none
   cp dist/plotly-almanac-bundle.min.js assets/js/lib/ `
   → then load the new file in _includes/header.html

x  how to ensure the bundle is up-to-date?

x error handling on d3js: if file exists
x check how to configure the plotly actions on top right (called modebar)
  x https://plotly.com/javascript/configuration-options/
  x eg. export SVG instead of PNG
  x remove some buttons → var config.
x Authorship: unpack function destroys the order of the affiliations, see how to fix that.
x Authorship: doesn't manage to get colors by affiliation
x use A19 colors only when generating colors
x find the art 19 blue hex value

* all plotly: if affiliation is empty, use the name instead (→ probably this will be handled by Seb)
* load the polyfill only in incompatible browsers?
* check out how to layout on mobile (some renderings may be too large) in portrait mode)
  - possibility: export everything as PNG and have mobile use these images instead
  - might require manual work
  - Plotly.newPlot('myDiv', data, layout, {staticPlot: true}); that creates a static chart, maybe that's useful

- data QuiC authorship: years look weird
  This is due to: https://plotly.com/javascript/tick-formatting/
  dtick needs to be 1 year in ms
  → this kind of removes the zoom level when zooming, so maybe we want to do that differently.
  → we can only scatter the authorship thingies more if we remove the date granularity in the data itself.
    not sure we want to do that.

x maybe have only one page in jekyll that calls everything dynamically
  according to a param in the URL. might need to use some yaml for that as some
  kind of DB
  - https://plotly.com/javascript/dropdowns/ that could be useful to load even the data dynamically
  - https://plotly.com/javascript/custom-buttons/
  * images
  * names
  * data

* have a page where catnip explains how this works
x maybe don't use the titles in the SVG, but have them in HTML
* catnip icon for plot titles

- do we need animations?

===========================================================

x visualization
  x do we want to export PNG or SVG (scalable but not for everyone), maybe we
    can do both
    → only one thing works at a time, I decided for SVG as this is scalable

===========================================================

- some issues on http://localhost:4000/viz.html?wg=ietf-quic
  x Leadership: Netapp should be a single actor on the y axis, even if it's two different persons
    → that was only due to two different spellings of NetApp/Netapp
  - Authorship: last line of Excel file was broken
  x Authorship: the x axis for the years is really weird, years are being repeated

- Linting
  - ES lint as git commit hook?
  - 'use strict';
  - check all variable names are correct and understandable
