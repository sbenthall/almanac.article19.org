x order affiliations alphabetically in leadership plots
- group affiliations in leadership:
  - periods seem to overlap, example:
    - ietf-quic: akami, BBC, cloudflare
    → sent email to Seb about that
- better color for Fastly (it's too similar to Cloudflare)
- simplify authorship JS: ordering by affiliation might be more simple
- verify the breadcrumbs for the dom part of the almanac

- think about how to represent influence over time
- think about how to represent chairs over time → that could be a question for the others
- add new catnip icons to findings page. Can they be fun somehow?
- add new catnip icons to dashboard, but keep it small
- have an error message if a file does not exist? that's visible to the user
- add a select to the findings page
- decide what should be the default view on the dashboard page, currently it's dnsop
- the footer bg image looks strange on the dashboard: it should be changed
- explain page:
  - have a logo of bigbang or some image illustrating the data (csv screenshot?)
  - have images of the dashboard in the how to use section
- fix the empty frames issue in the overview/findings JS
- use findings plots to create map images:
  - overlay all the years for authorship

x rename d-about to dom-overview
x rename dashboard to dom-dashboard
x rename d-explain to dom-explain
x fix all the links

x make plotly library lighter
  https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CUSTOM_BUNDLE.md

  `mkdir bundle
   npm i plotly.js
   cd node_modules/plotly.js
   npm i
   npm run custom-bundle -- --out almanac-bundle --traces scatter --transforms none
   cp dist/plotly-almanac-bundle.min.js assets/js/lib/ `
   → then load the new file in _includes/header.html
-  how to ensure the bundle is up-to-date?

x error handling on d3js: if file exists
x check how to configure the plotly actions on top right (called modebar)
  x https://plotly.com/javascript/configuration-options/
  x eg. export SVG instead of PNG
  x remove some buttons → var config.
x Authorship: unpack function destroys the order of the affiliations, see how to fix that.
x Authorship: doesn't manage to get colors by affiliation
x use A19 colors only when generating colors
x find the art 19 blue hex value

* all plotly: if affiliation is empty, use the name instead (→ probably this will be handled by Seb)
* load the polyfill only in incompatible browsers?
* check out how to layout on mobile (some renderings may be too large) in portrait mode)
  / possibility: export everything as SVG and have mobile use these images instead
  / might require manual work
  - Plotly.newPlot('myDiv', data, layout, {staticPlot: true}); that creates a static chart, maybe that's useful
  - alert people who watch the dashboard on a vertical phone or on a horizontal with less than 1024px width that they should turn their phone or use a larger screen
  x small screens: use horizontal legend below
  x small screens: adjust placement of the y axis title
  x small screens: adjust width of legend (influence)

- data QuiC authorship: years look weird
  This is due to: https://plotly.com/javascript/tick-formatting/
  dtick needs to be 1 year in ms
  → this kind of removes the zoom level when zooming, so maybe we want to do that differently.
  → we can only scatter the authorship thingies more if we remove the date granularity in the data itself.
    not sure we want to do that.

x variable vizexists in groups and WG variable should just be the abbreviation
  of the WG and we need to find the files like that because they will be named like this by Seb

x maybe have only one page in jekyll that calls everything dynamically
  according to a param in the URL. might need to use some yaml for that as some
  kind of DB
  - https://plotly.com/javascript/dropdowns/ that could be useful to load even the data dynamically
  - https://plotly.com/javascript/custom-buttons/
  * images
  * names
  * data

* have a page where catnip explains how this works
x maybe don't use the titles in the SVG, but have them in HTML
* catnip icon for plot titles

x do we need animations? → will be used in findings page
  https://plotly.com/javascript/gapminder-example/

===========================================================

x visualization
  x do we want to export PNG or SVG (scalable but not for everyone), maybe we
    can do both
    → only one thing works at a time, I decided for SVG as this is scalable

===========================================================

- some issues on http://localhost:4000/viz.html?wg=ietf-quic
  x Leadership: Netapp should be a single actor on the y axis, even if it's two different persons
    → that was only due to two different spellings of NetApp/Netapp
  - Authorship: last line of Excel file was broken
  x Authorship: the x axis for the years is really weird, years are being repeated

- Linting
  - ES lint as git commit hook?
  - 'use strict';
  - check all variable names are correct and understandable

- automatically build jekyll _site on Github?

============================================================

x navigation between workgroup in almanac and workgroup in viz
  x needs design
- Rename groups in old almanac and have an .htaccess for redirection, rely on shortname
  - do it only for IETF and IRTF for now
  x done: IETF

- fix breadcrumbs in viz area
- actually give colors to specific affiliations in assets/js/helper-functions.js
