* make plotly library lighter
  https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CUSTOM_BUNDLE.md
* error handling on d3js: if file exists
* load the polyfill only in incompatible browsers?
* check out how to layout on mobile (some renderings may be too large) in portrait mode)
  - possibility: export everything as PNG and have mobile use these images instead
  - might require manual work
  - Plotly.newPlot('myDiv', data, layout, {staticPlot: true}); that creates a static chart, maybe that's useful
x check how to configure the plotly actions on top right (called modebar)
  x https://plotly.com/javascript/configuration-options/
  x eg. export SVG instead of PNG
  x remove some buttons → var config.
* Authorship: unpack function destroys the order of the affiliations, see how to fix that.
* all plotly: if affiliation is empty, use the name instead

* maybe have only one page in jekyll that calls everything dynamically
  according to a param in the URL. might need to use some yaml for that as some
  kind of DB
  - https://plotly.com/javascript/dropdowns/ that could be useful to load even the data dynamically
  - https://plotly.com/javascript/custom-buttons/
  * images
  * names
  * data

* have a page where catnip explains how this works
x maybe don't use the titles in the SVG, but have them in HTML
* catnip icon for plot titles

* use A19 colors only when generating colors

- do we need animations?

===========================================================

- visualization
  x do we want to export PNG or SVG (scalable but not for everyone), maybe we
    can do both
    → only one thing works at a time, I decided for SVG as this is scalable

===========================================================

- some issues on http://localhost:4000/viz.html?wg=ietf-quic
  x Leadership: Netapp should be a single actor on the y axis, even if it's two different persons
    → that was only due to two different spellings of NetApp/Netapp
  - Authorship: last line of Excel file was broken
  x Authorship: the x axis for the years is really weird, years are being repeated
