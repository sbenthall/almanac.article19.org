    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>MRPT_WG aims to make privacy terms of engagement machine-readable,
        so that devices and machines on a network agree on how to disclose or
        use information. Server operators normally proffer all terms of
        engagement, including privacy terms. This work may increase user choice
        and autonomy by allowing end-users to have the ability to assert their
         own legally binding permissions for data collection, use, sharing, and
         retention by the technologies they use.  </p>
