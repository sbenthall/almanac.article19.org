    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>RAIS_WG aims to define specifications to guide developers in
        building AI-based systems, including image recognition systems. These
        specifications are set out to test for accuracy, ensure resistance
        against malicious attacks by third parties, and ensure that the system
        cannot be easily fooled by adversarial attacks that expose its
        weaknesses. Facial characteristics within images can be subject to
        racial and gender bias from image recognition systems, which can
        compromise an individualâ€™s ability to use various software and
        applications. Moreover, the normalisation of facial recognition use may
        further facilitate the biometric mass surveillance of people and
        communities.  </p>
