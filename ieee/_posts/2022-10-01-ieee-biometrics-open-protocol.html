    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>This group aims to build frameworks to store biometric data securely
        against cyber attacks. The market’s uptake in biometric technologies
        combined with the increase in cyber attacks can lead to the identifying
        and tracking individuals using their biometric data. BOPs aim to handle
        biometric data securely by breaking up information – referred to as
        distributed data – and establishing communication with the server
        through end-to-end authentication.</p>
