        <p>
        BOP aims to build frameworks to store biometric data securely against
        cyber attacks. The uptake of biometric technologies, combined with
        increases in cyberattacks, can expose individuals whose biometric data
        are implicated in these systems and leave them vulnerable to being
        identified, tracked, and monitored. BOP aims to secure biometric data
        by breaking up information – referred to as distributed data – and
        establishing communication with the server through end-to-end
        authentication.
