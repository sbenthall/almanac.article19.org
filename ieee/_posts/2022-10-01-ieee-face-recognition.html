    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>There are many <a class="glossary" href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-facial-recognition">face recognition products</a> on the market and also a very wide set of applications and users interested in deploying this type of technology. This group aims to define both architecture and technical requirements for face recognition systems, specifically those related to function, performance, and security. Facial recognition technologies can normalise mass surveillance, as they can profile and track individuals in public spaces based on facial characteristics. This can be misused to target marginalised communities and stifle participation in protests. There are also concerns over racial and gender bias where individuals have been wrongfully arrested based on erroneous facial recognition matches.</p>
