        <p>DI aims to standardise the requirements for blockchain-based digital
        identity systems. The group also aims to enable acceptance and
        interoperability between different digital identity systems through the
        use of digital identity blockchains.  <a

        class="glossary">Digital identity systems</a> can incur issues of
        data security and identity fraud. The use of digital identity
        systems to govern access to public services may further exclude
        people and communities that are already in positions of political,
        social, or economic vulnerability and may be exploited to track and
        monitor individuals and groups.</p>
