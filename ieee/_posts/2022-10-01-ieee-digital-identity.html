        <p>This group aims to standardise the requirements for blockchain-based
        digital identity systems. <a

        class="glossary">Digital identity systems</a> can pose issues of data
        security and identity fraud, and could prevent marginalised communities from
        accessing their online identity. The group also aims to enable acceptance and
        interoperability between different digital identity systems through the use of
        digital identity blockchains.</p>
