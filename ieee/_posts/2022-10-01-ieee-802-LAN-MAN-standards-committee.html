        <p>This committee develops and maintains a collection of networking
        standards and recommended practices for local, urban, and other area
        networks that cover the <a

        class="glossary">media access control</a> (MAC) and physical layer
        protocols that facilitate how different devices connect with each other and to
        wider networks, and what information is shared between devices and
        networks. Malicious actors can potentially eavesdrop into the
        communications of individuals who are connected to the network, or
        track people based on their geolocation sent to the network. This can
        compromise a user's privacy and safety.</p>
