        The 802 LMSC develops and maintains a collection of networking
        standards and recommended practices for local, urban, and other area
        networks that cover the <a
        href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8866/physical-layer"
        class="glossary">physical</a> and <a
        href="https://osi-model.com/data-link-layer/"
        class="glossary">data-link</a> layer specifications for
        technologies such as Ethernet, bridging and virtual bridged
        local area networks (LANs), and wireless LANs (WLANs). It
        specifies the set of <a
        href="https://www.getkisi.com/blog/media-access-control"
        class="glossary">media access control</a> (MAC) and
        physical layer protocols that facilitate how different
        devices connect with each other and to wider networks, and
        what information is shared between devices and networks.
        Malicious actors can potentially eavesdrop on the
        communications of individuals who are connected to
        unsecured networks, or track people based on metadata sent
        over these networks. These vulnerabilities can compromise
        usersâ€™ privacy and safety. Small, alternative, and
        non-profit network operators that provide last-mile
        connectivity to rural and remote communities often rely on
        Wi-Fi technologies for networking. Meaningful connectivity
        to the internet enables the realisation of all human
        rights.
