        <p>
        The P7000 working group develops methodologies to identify, analyse,
        and reconcile ethical concerns throughout the various stages of
        software design. It also defines processes for engineers to translate
        stakeholder values and ethical considerations into system requirements
        and design practices, as well as a systematic, transparent, and
        traceable approach to address regulatory obligations in the design of
        autonomous intelligent systems.</p>
