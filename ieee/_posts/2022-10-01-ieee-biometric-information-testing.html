    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>BITWG aims to build a secure, low-cost, and industry-wide
        fingerprint test system for mobile devices. Fingerprints are biometric
        data that are widely used for identification and authentication
        purposes. The design and evaluation of application and hardware
        specifications of these biometric test systems can therefore impact how
        personally identifiable information is stored and shared, impacting
        peopleâ€™s privacy.</p>
