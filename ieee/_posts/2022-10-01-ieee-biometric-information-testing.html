        <p>This group aims to build a secure, low cost, and industry-wide
        accepted fingerprint test system for mobile devices. <a

        class="glossary">Testing fingerprint verification</a> is critical given its
        use for identification, authentification, and recognition purposes. The design
        and evaluation, including application and hardware specifications of these
        biometric test systems, can impact how personally identifiable information is
        stored and shared, impacting peopleâ€™s privacy.
