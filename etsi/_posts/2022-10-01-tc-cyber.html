        TC Cyber aims to address and maintain the security of ICT systems and
        networks, specifically network infrastructures, devices, services, and
        protocols. While the security of ICT systems may in turn promote the
        security of end users, these standards and protocols can also normalise
        surveillance, which can ultimately encroach upon individualsâ€™ privacy.
