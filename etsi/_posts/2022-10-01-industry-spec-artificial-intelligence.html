        The group is responsible for developing technical standards to mitigate
        threats arising from the deployment of AI throughout multiple
        ICT-related industries. It focuses on using AI to enhance security,
        mitigating against attacks that leverage AI, and securing AI itself
        from attack. This is important because autonomous mechanical and
        computing entities may make decisions that act against the relying
        parties either by design or as a result of malicious intent.
