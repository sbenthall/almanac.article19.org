        The ISG SAI is responsible for developing technical standards to
        mitigate threats arising from the deployment of artificial intelligence
        (AI) in a range of ICT-related industries. It focuses on the use of AI
        to enhance security, mitigation measures against attacks that leverage
        AI, and the security of AI itself. Autonomous mechanical and computing
        entities may make decisions that act against people and communities
        that must rely on them, either by design or as a result of malicious
        intent.
