        <p>
        The technical committee develops standards to support the development
        and implementation of intelligent transport systems (ITS) service
        provision across networks for transport and vehicles. Standards address
        the overall communication architecture, management, access and security
        with the aim of increasing travel safety, minimising environmental
        impact, improving traffic management and maximising the benefits of
        transportation. The ubiquitous use of sensor technologies can normalise
        mass surveillance in public spaces, affecting how people exercise their
        rights â€“ including the right to protest on streets and roads. Insurance
        companies can potentially use the data collected by sensors to track a
        vehicle's movement. This can be used to determine insurance costs, a
        practice that could disproportionately affect marginalised communities.
