        <p>
        TC ITS develops standards to support the development and implementation
        of intelligent transport systems (ITS), including service provision
        across networks for transport and vehicles. Standards address the
        overall communication architecture as well as management, access, and
        security elements, with the aim of increasing travel safety, minimising
        environmental impact, improving traffic management, and maximising the
        benefits of transportation. The ubiquitous use of sensor technologies
        embedded in ITS can normalise mass surveillance in public spaces,
        affecting how people exercise their rights â€“ including the right to
        protest on streets. Insurance companies can potentially use the data
        collected by sensors to determine insurance costs, a practice that
        could disproportionately affect marginalised communities.
