        <p>
        TC LI develops standards supporting international requirements for law
        enforcement agencies to intercept and retain electronic communication
        data sent over public communication services. It is responsible for the
        control and handover interface and the rules of delivery of
        technology-specific interception or retained data. Lawful interception
        is a security process in which a service provider or network operator
        is legally obligated to collect and provide law enforcement with
        intercepted communications of private individuals or organisations.
        However, technical features that enable lawful interception within
        mobile telecommunications can be abused by state actors or exploited by
        malicious actors.
