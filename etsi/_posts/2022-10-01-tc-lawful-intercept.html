        The technical committee for Lawful Interception develops standards supporting international
        requirements for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) to intercept and retain
        electronic communications data sent over public communication services. It is
        responsible for the control and handover interface, and for rules of delivery
        of technology-specific interception or retained data (lawful disclosure, or
        LD). As a legally sanctioned official access to private communications, Lawful
        Interception (LI) is a security process in which a service provider or network
        operator is legally obligated to collect and provide law enforcement with
        intercepted communications of private individuals or organisations. However,
        the technical features that enable lawful interception within mobile
        telecommunications can be abused by state actors or exploited by malicious
        actors.
