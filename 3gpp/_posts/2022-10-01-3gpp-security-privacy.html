    <h1 class="title">Technical Specification Group Service & System Aspects, Working Group 3 on Security and Privacy |&nbsp;SA3</h1>
    <div class="wg-description">
        SA3 develops standards that define the specific requirements, architecture, and protocols for security and privacy in 3GPP systems. Secure communications in these systems is key to preventing both state and non-state actors from unlawfully eavesdropping and monitoring people. SA3 is responsible for identifying security and privacy requirements for 3GPP systems through threat and risk analyses, and defining the security architectures and associated protocols to address these requirements. It also ensures that cryptographic algorithms for data encryption, authentication, and digital signatures – which need to be part of the 5G security specifications – are available to ensure confidentiality and integrity of communications.

        <li><b>Published technical specification:</b> <a href="https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3169">3GPP TS 33.501</a> provides a detailed description of the security architecture and procedures for 5G systems, enhancing the flexible authentication framework in 5G. The technical specification allows the use of credentials other than the SIM card and enhances subscriber privacy features, potentially putting an end to the threat that international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) catchers pose.</li>
