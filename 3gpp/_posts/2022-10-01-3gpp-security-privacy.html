    <div class="wg-description">
        This working group develops standards that define the specific
        requirements, architecture and protocols for security and privacy in
        3GPP systems. Secure communications in these systems is key to
        preventing both state and non-state actors from unlawfully
        eavesdropping and monitoring people. It is responsible for identifying
        the security and privacy requirements through a threat and risk
        analysis and defining the security architectures and associated
        protocols to address these requirements. It also ensures that
        cryptographic algorithms for data encryption, authentication and
        digital signatures – which need to be part of the 5G security
        specifications – are available in order to ensure confidentiality and
        integrity of communications.

        <li><b>Published standard:</b> <a href="https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3169">3GPP TS 33.501</a> provides a detailed description of security architecture and procedures for 5G systems, enhancing the flexible authentication framework in 5G. That allows the use of different types of credentials besides the SIM card and enhances subscriber privacy features, putting an end to the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) catcher threat.</li>
