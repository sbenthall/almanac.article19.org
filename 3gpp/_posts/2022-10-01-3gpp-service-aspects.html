    <div class="wg-description">
        SA3-LI provides requirements and specifications for facilitating lawful
        interception in 3GPP systems. Lawful interception is a security process
        in which a service provider or network operator is legally obligated to
        collect and provide law enforcement with intercepted communications of
        private individuals or organisations. However, technical features that
        enable lawful interception can be abused by state actors or exploited
        by malicious actors. In recent years, the main actors involved in
        influencing and shaping these standards, other than companies such as
        Nokia and Ericsson, have been governments primarily from Europe, North
        America, and their respective national law enforcement agencies. Other
        actors participating in this subcommittee include telecommunication
        infrastructure providers, network providers, cybersecurity companies,
        network equipment providers and consulting groups working on behalf of
        governments.
