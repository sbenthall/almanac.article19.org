    <h1 class="title">Service and Aspects Working Group 3 - Lawful Intercept | SA3-LI</h1>
    <div class="wg-description">
        Within SA3, the sub-working group SA3-LI provides the requirements and
        specifications for lawful interception in 3GPP systems. Lawful
        intercept is a regulatory and legal obligation towards law enforcement
        agencies that communication service providers must comply with. This
        obligation allows the appropriate authorities to perform interception
        of communication traffic for specific users. In recent years, other
        than private sector companies such as Nokia and Ericsson, the main
        actors involved in influencing and shaping these standards are
        governments primarily from Europe, North America, and their respective
        national law enforcement agencies. The other actors involved are
        telecoms infrastructure providers, network providers, cybersecurity
        companies, network equipment providers and consulting groups working on
        behalf of governments.
