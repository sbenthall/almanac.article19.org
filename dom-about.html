    <h2 class="title">1. The number of formal positions in standards
        developing organisations such as working group/committee chairs by
        actor</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Formal positions have a direct impact on shaping the agenda and
        discussions, who has the chance to speak, and which proposals and
        contributions are accepted. From ARTICLE 19’s own experience engaging
        in technical standards, we’ve seen chairs have total control of when a
        meeting starts and ends, particularly when conducted remotely.</p>

    <h2 class="title">2. The number of authorships of published technical standards by actor</h2>
    <div>
        <p> Authorship is one of the most direct ways to engage in standards
        development. Authors have more control over the process as they lead
        and facilitate the proposal through decision-making discussions. As
        technical standardisation is a lengthy process, a draft or a proposal
        made by a participant in an SDO must be reviewed and accepted by its
        technical community. Even if a draft is published, it is subject to
        iterative improvements and deliberations from the community. Publishing
        a draft does not guarantee that it will become a standard. By authoring
        a published standard, participants must successfully dedicate time and
        resources, and persuade the technical community within the respective
        decision making process. Therefore, for the purpose of this research,
        we focused our analysis on authorship of published standards only.</p>

    <h2 class="title">3. The amount of actor’s involvement and
        communication in technical decision-making processes</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Various standards developing organisations continue to use mailing
        lists as a primary mode of participation and communication in working
        groups and committees. Actors can actively make contributions and
        object to various proposals. Analysing mailing lists provides further
        information into how dominant participants’ involvement and
        communication is within the decision making process.</p>

    <h2 class="title">About the data</h2>
    <div>
        <p>For this research, we leveraged various web-scraping tools to
        analyse which actors dominate technical standardisation through three
        modes mentioned here. In order to study which actors dominate the
        development of technical standards, we use BigBang to provide a
        quantitative and qualitative analysis of mailing lists (mailman and
        Listserv).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><b>About BigBang</b></p>
        <p>What's BigBang? How was the data obtained?</p>
        <p>Was the data anonymized or altered and if yes, how?</p>
        <p>Potentially link BigBang, potentially link the data on Github.</p>

    <h2 class="title">How to use the dashboard?</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Select the working group or organisation you want to look at. By
        default, you’ll see information about the “dnsop” working group in the
        IETF. The dashboard then contains three different visualisations for
        each authorship, influence, and leadership in the selected group or
        organisation.</p>
        <p>On devices with a small screen information shown and user interaction is reduced; we therefore recommend using the dashboard on a screen with a higher resolution.</p>
        <p>Hovering any of the three visualisation plots with the cursor will make available options for interacting with the plot appear on the top right. Here are the basic options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each plot can be zoomed in, zoomed out, and reset to the initial scale.</li>
            <li>Exporting plots. Plots can be exported by clicking on the camera icon. The export will always show the current view (i.e the currently visible selection and current zoom level). The exported file is a scalable vector image with a transparent background.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On the plots themselves, each actor can be shown separately. Isolate the actor you’d like to see by double clicking on their name in the legend below / to the right of each plot. Toggle more actors on and off by clicking on them.</p>
