        <p>This committee develops standards on the requirements, frameworks,
        guidance, and tools to build resilient and sustainable smart cities and
        communities. Systems designed off <a
        href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot"
        class="glossary">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> technologies (devices with
        technologies that are connected to each other) can capture extensive data and
        create an environment that normalises constant tracking and monitoring. The
        committee defines basic concepts as well as specifications for measurement,
        reporting, and verification of these technologies. The centralisation and
        integration of data for vital infrastructure and services could lead to
        increased data breaches
        or attacks, user privacy issues, and pervasive government
        surveillance.</p>
