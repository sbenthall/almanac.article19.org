        <p>This committee, convened solely by ISO, develops standards on the
        requirements, frameworks, guidance, and tools to build resilient and
        sustainable smart cities and communities. Systems designed based on
        <a

        class="glossary">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>
        models can capture extensive data and create
        an environment that normalises constant tracking and monitoring. The
        committee defines basic concepts and develops specifications for
        measurement, reporting, and verification of these technologies. The
        centralisation and integration of data for vital infrastructure and
        services could lead to increased data breaches or attacks, privacy
        issues, and pervasive government surveillance.</p>
