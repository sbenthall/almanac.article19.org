        <p>This committee, convened solely by ISO, produces standards on the
        overall system aspects and infrastructure aspects of 
        <a href="https://www.itsstandards.eu/">intelligent transport systems (ITS)</a>.
        ITS comprises various forms of information and
        communication technologies embedded in different modes of transport
        that interact with each other through, for example, sensor technologies
        that monitor roads and vehicles. The ubiquitous use of sensor
        technologies embedded in ITS can normalise mass surveillance in public
        spaces, affecting how people exercise their rights â€“ including the
        right to protest on streets and roads. Insurance companies can
        potentially use the data collected by sensors to determine insurance
        costs, a practice that could disproportionately affect marginalised
        communities.</p>
