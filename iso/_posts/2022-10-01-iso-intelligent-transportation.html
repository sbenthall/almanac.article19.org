        <p>This committee produces standards on the overall system aspects and infrastructure aspects of <a href="https://www.itsstandards.eu/">intelligent transport systems (ITS)</a>. ITS comprises various forms of information and communication technologies embedded in different modes of transport that interact with each other through, for example, sensor technology that monitor roads and vehicles. The ubiquitous use of sensor technologies can normalise mass surveillance in public spaces, affecting how people exercise their rights â€“ including the right to protest on streets and roads. Insurance companies can potentially use the data collected by sensors to track a vehicle's movement. This can be used to determine insurance costs, a practice that could disproportionately affect marginalised communities.</p>
