    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>Under JTC1, convened jointly by ISO and IEC, this working group
        develops international standards for smart cities and the use of
        particular technologies in smart cities. Smart cities are generally
        composed of a mix of technical infrastructure, like public Wi-Fi,
        surveillance equipment, like cameras and sensors, and smart
        identification systems. They are designed to sense and capture data,
        creating an environment of constant tracking, monitoring, and profiling
        in the critical places where people and communities express themselves,
        including through protests. The working group collaborates closely with
        the <a href="{{ site.url }}/orgs/6_itu-t.html">ITU-T</a>, as well as
        other ISO groups.  </p>
