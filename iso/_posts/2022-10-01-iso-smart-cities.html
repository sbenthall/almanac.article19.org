    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>This group develops standards for the use of technology in smart cities and international standards for smart cities themselves. Smart cities are usually made up of a mix of technical infrastructure like public Wi-Fi, surveillance equipment like cameras and sensors, and smart identification systems. They are designed to sense and capture data, creating an environment of constant tracking, monitoring, and profiling in the critical places where the public express themselves, including through protests. The group collaborates closely with the <a href="{{ site.url }}/orgs/6_itu-t.html">ITU-T</a> as well as other ISO groups.</p>
