        <p>
        Under JTC1, convened jointly by ISO and IEC, this subcommittee develops
        standards for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the broader
        AI ecosystem. It also provides guidance to other ISO and IEC committees
        that develop AI applications. Data-intensive technologies such as AI
        can extract or infer sensitive data about users, from their biometric
        information to their behaviours. As such, they can normalise mass
        surveillance, tracking, and profiling of individuals in both online and
        offline spaces, affecting how people will exercise their rights to
        privacy and freedom of expression.
