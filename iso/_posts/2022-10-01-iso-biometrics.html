    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>Under JTC1, convened jointly by ISO and IEC, this subcommittee
        develops international standards and technical reports to ensure that
        biometric recognition systems and applications are interoperable,
        scalable, and secure. The uptake of biometric technologies, combined
        with increases in cyberattacks, can expose individuals whose biometric
        data are implicated in these systems and leave them vulnerable to being
        identified, tracked, and monitored.</p>
