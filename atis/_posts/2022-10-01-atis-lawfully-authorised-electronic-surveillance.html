    <div class="wg-description">
        PTSC LAES develops standards and technical reports for lawfully
        intercepting wireline telecommunication data in line with the
        U.S.Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) and
        related Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. Lawful
        interception is a security process in which a service provider or
        network operator is legally obligated to collect and provide law
        enforcement with intercepted communications of private individuals or
        organisations. However, technical features that enable lawful
        interception can be abused by state actors or exploited by malicious
        actors.
