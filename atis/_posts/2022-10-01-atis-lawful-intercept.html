    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>
        WTSC LI develops standards and technical reports related to wireless or
        mobile services and systems, including telecommunication networks such
        as 5G. The subcommittee coordinates lawful interception activities
        amongst North American partners, evaluates proposals for lawful
        interception capabilities, and interprets the security and lawful
        interception requirements. Lawful interception is a security process in
        which a service provider or network operator is legally obligated to
        collect and provide law enforcement with intercepted communications of
        private individuals or organisations. However, technical features that
        enable lawful interception can be abused by state actors or exploited
        by malicious actors. The subcommittee also develops and coordinates
        appropriate inputs regarding lawful interception aspects that impact or
        are impacted by ITU standards.
