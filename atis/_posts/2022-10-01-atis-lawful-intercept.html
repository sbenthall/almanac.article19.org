    <h1 class="title">Wireless Technologies and Systems Committee | WTSC - Lawful Intercept Subcommittee | LI</h1>
    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>WTSC LI develops standards and technical reports related to wireless
        or mobile services and systems, including telecommunication networks
        such as 5G. The subcommittee coordinates lawful interception activities
        amongst North American partners, evaluates proposals for lawful
        interception capabilities, and interprets the security and lawful
        interception requirements. Technical features that enable lawful
        interception within mobile telecommunications can be abused by state
        actors or exploited by malicious actors. The subcommittee also develops
        and coordinates appropriate inputs regarding lawful interception
        aspects that impact or are impacted by the International
        Telecommunication Union standards.  </p>
