    <h1 class="title">Technical Committee 224 - Working Group 18 Personal Identification | CEN/TC 224</h1>
    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>This group develops standards to strengthen the interoperability and
        security of personal identification systems and personal devices. The
        increasingly widespread use of biometric technologies for personal
        identification and authentication poses major challenges to users'
        privacy, specifically the covert collection of data and in the form of
        function creep, whereby these technologies are gradually used beyond
        the purpose of their original intention. The group also develops
        requirements for biometric authentication technologies and requirements
        to protect user data privacy, specifically in regards to how
        individualsâ€™ consent for how their data is collected and used.</p>
