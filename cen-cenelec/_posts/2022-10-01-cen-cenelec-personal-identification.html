    <h1 class="title">Technical Committee 224, Working Group 18 on Personal Identification |&nbsp;CEN/TC&nbsp;224</h1>
    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>TC 224, which is convened solely by CEN, develops standards to
        strengthen the interoperability and security of personal identification
        systems and personal devices. The increasingly widespread use of
        biometric technologies for personal identification and authentication
        poses major challenges to users' privacy, including the covert
        collection of data and function creep whereby these technologies are
        gradually used beyond the purpose of their original intention. The
        group also develops requirements for biometric authentication
        technologies and requirements to protect user privacy, including those
        related to obtaining individualsâ€™ consent for how their data is
        collected and used.  </p>
