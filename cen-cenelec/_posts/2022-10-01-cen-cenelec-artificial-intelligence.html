    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>JTC 21, jointly convened by CEN and CENELEC, develops artificial intelligence (AI) standards and provides guidance to other technical committees and working groups on matters relating to AI. The committee addresses AI-related issues that are particularly relevant to the European context and potential gaps in the current standards landscape. Data intensive technologies such as AI can extract or infer personal data about users, from their biometric information to their behaviours. As such, they can normalise mass surveillance, tracking, and profiling of individuals in both online and offline spaces, affecting how people will exercise their rights to privacy and freedom of expression. CEN-CLC JTC 21 will likely develop standards linked to the European Union AI Act, under the direction of the European Commission.

The collection, retention, and use of users’ data, based on their personalisations and choices online, increases the risk to users' privacy and exposes individuals and groups to manipulation.
