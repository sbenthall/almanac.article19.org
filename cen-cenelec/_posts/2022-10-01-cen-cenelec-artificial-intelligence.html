    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>This committee develops AI standards and provides guidance to other technical committees and working groups concerned with AI. The group aims to highlight AI topics of high importance in a European context and map out potential gaps in the current standards landscape. One of the standards being developed is on the <a href="https://standardsdevelopment.bsigroup.com/projects/9022-07022#/section">definition and guidelines for AI-enhanced nudging</a> by organisations. <a class="glossary" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-016-0453-1">Digital nudging</a> is the use of design elements to guide users’ behaviour and influence choice in a digital environment. It has the ability to learn from users’ personalised data and choices online, which increases the risk to users' privacy and exposes users as well as groups to manipulation. Data intensive technologies such as AI can extract or infer sensitive data about users, from their behaviours to their biometrics. This can normalise mass surveillance, tracking, and profiling of individuals in both online and offline spaces, affecting how people will exercise their rights to privacy and freedom of expression. CEN-CLC JTC 21 will develop the standards linked to the AI Act, after a request of the European Commission for safe and trustworthy AI.</p>
