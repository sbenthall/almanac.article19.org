    <h2 class="title">Welcome!</h2> 
    <p>This is a guide for those who are curious about engaging in the
    standardisation of internet infrastructure, but might not be sure about how,
    where, and which issues are up for discussion. This almanac answers two primary
    questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="bubble">Which groups and committees are developing standards that have human rights implications?</li>
        <li class="bubble">How do these standards impact human rights?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here, you’ll find the major internet-related standards developing
    organisations (SDOs), and the various groups and committees within each of
    them that are working on relevant issues. <a href="{{ site.url }}/by-issue-all.html">Using the tags</a>, you can organise
    your search by topic to identify which groups or committees are working on
    a particular issue or impacting a particular right.</p>
    <p><b>Happy exploring!</b></p>
