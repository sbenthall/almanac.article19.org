    <h1 class="title">The European Committee for Standardisation |&nbsp;CEN and the
        European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation |&nbsp;CENELEC</h1>
    <p>CEN and CENELEC are two distinct standards organisations in Europe
    responsible for the development of standards and technical reports across
    various sectors. The two membership organisations collaborate on a broad
    range of technical standards in various fields, from optical fibre cables,
    energy supply, to IT service management. They can also contextualise
    ISO/IEC standards to be applied to the European context. Civil society can
    participate by paying and becoming a member of three designated member
    organisations that represent consumers, environmental and societal
    interests: <a href="https://www.anec.eu/">ANEC</a>, the <a
    href="https://www.etuc.org/en">European Trade Union Confederation</a>
    (ETUC), and the <a href="https://ecostandard.org/">Environmental Coalition
    on Standards</a> (ECOS). This is one avenue for participation in
    addition to participating through national standards organisations. ANEC,
    ETUC and ECOS experts participate with equal rights in the working groupsâ€™
    drafting of standards within the European Standards
    Organisations (ESOs). However, they have restricted participation as
    observers in technical committees, preventing them from making final
    decisions on standards and technical reports. Alternatively, civil society
    can participate through national standards organisations which have
    influence over these final decisions.</p>
