        European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization |&nbsp;CENELEC</h1>
    <p>
    CEN and CENELEC are two distinct standards organisations in Europe
    responsible for the development of standards and technical reports across
    various sectors. They collaborate on a broad range of technical standards
    in various fields, from optical fibre cables, to energy management, to IT
    service management. Both organisations are officially recognised as
    European Standards Organizations (ESOs). As such, they have a mandate to
    develop ICT standards and support for European regulations and legislation
    through the development of Harmonised European Standards. If a manufacturer
    wants to enter its product into the EU Single Market, it must comply with
    certain minimum safety and procedural requirements set in Harmonised
    European Standards. CEN and CENELEC also contextualise <a
    href="{{ site.url }}/orgs/5_iso.html">ISO/IEC</a> standards
    to be applied to the European context. Civil society can participate by paying
    dues and becoming a member of three designated member organisations that
    represent consumer, environmental, and societal interests: <a
    href="https://www.anec.eu/">ANEC</a>, the <a
    href="https://www.etuc.org/en">European Trade Union Confederation</a> (ETUC) ,
    and the <a href="https://ecostandard.org/">Environmental Coalition on
    Standards</a> (ECOS). ANEC, ETUC, and ECOS experts participate with equal
    rights in CEN and CENELEC working groups. However, their participation is more
    restricted in technical committees, where, as observers, they are prevented
    from influencing final decisions on standards and technical reports.
    Alternatively, civil society can participate through national standards bodies
    (NSBs) representing the interests of countries in the region. NSBs have
    influence over final decisions related to CEN/CENELEC standards and technical
    reports.
