    <h1 class="title">International Organisation for Standards |&nbsp;ISO and International Electrotechnical Commission |&nbsp;IEC</h1>
    <p>ISO is an international, inter-governmental membership organisation that develops and publishes a broad range of standards for technical and non-technical fields, such as quality and environmental management systems, occupational health and safety, and IT service management. Membership is exclusive to one national standards body (NSB) per country. ISO also has a joint technical committee (JTC) with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) to develop IT-related standards. The IEC is an international non-profit membership organisation that develops standards for all electrical and electronic and related technologies. Civil society organisations must work with a member NSB, which will in turn determine whether and how the civil society organisation may participate in developing ISO or ISO/IEC standards.</p>
