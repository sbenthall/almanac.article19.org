    <h1 class="title">ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector |&nbsp;ITU-T</h1>
    <p>The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is a UN specialised
    agency that is responsible for matters related to ICT infrastructure
    technologies. The ITUâ€™s Technical Standardization Sector (ITU-T) sets
    standards for telecommunication and ICT infrastructure technologies, such
    as cellular networks. These standards determine how sensitive information
    is transmitted and stored in everyday communications, as well as how power
    and control are concentrated or exercised across networks. The ITU is an
    intergovernmental organisation where only Member States have voting rights.
    While civil society can technically become Sector Members of the ITU-T,
    membership fees are generally required and it can be difficult to
    successfully secure fee waivers or affordances.
