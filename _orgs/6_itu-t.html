    <p>The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is a UN specialised
    agency that is responsible for matters related to ICT infrastructure
    technologies. The ITUâ€™s Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) in
    particular sets standards for ICT infrastructure technologies such as
    cellular networks. As ICT infrastructure technologies become increasingly
    ubiquitous, these standards determine how sensitive information is
    transmitted and stored in everyday communications. The ITU is a
    multilateral organisation where only nation states have voting rights.
    While civil society can technically become Sector Members, this may come at
    a large cost.</p>
