    <h1 class="title">ITU Radiocommunication Sector |&nbsp;ITU&#8209;R</h1>
    <p>The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is a UN specialised
    agency that is responsible for matters related to telecommunication and ICT
    infrastructure technologies. The ITU’s Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R)
    sets standards for radiocommunication systems, which include spectrum
    management and radiocommunication. Spectrum is an essential resource for
    wireless technologies and its allocation determines which operators can
    provide internet services to communities. This in turn determines which
    communities have the ability to access and connect to the internet. The
    ITU-R also develops recommendations in the implementation of these
    standards and regulations. The ITU is a multilateral organisation where
    only nation states have voting rights. While civil society can technically
    become Sector Members this comes at a large cost.</p>
