    <h1 class="title">Internet Engineering Task Force |&nbsp;IETF</h1>
    <p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) develops and promotes a wide
    range of internet protocols and standards at the logical layer, including
    the Internet Protocol suite (TCP/IP). Many of these protocols relate to the
    Domain Name System (DNS), the directory of the internet which translates
    domain names to IP addresses. This allows browsers and other tools to
    connect to the right website or other network service. These standards
    influence the way people design, use, and manage the internet. While IETF
    does not require formal membership and all participants are volunteers, a
    large number of participants are sent by their companies to create
    particular technologies, or add to their development. There are also large
    costs associated with travelling to three in-person meetings around the
    world every year â€“ besides the US$875 registration fee. Draft documents and
    proposals at the IETF are known as Internet-Drafts (I-D). Once reviewed and
    published, they become a Request for Comment (RFC). RFCs can be classified
    as standard, informational, experimental, or historic.  </p>
