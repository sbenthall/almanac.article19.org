    <h1 class="title">World Wide Web Consortium&nbsp;|&nbsp;W3C</h1>
    <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops technical standards and
    guidelines for web technologies such as HTML and CSS. These standards
    influence the way people browse and use web services. The W3C is a
    membership organisation, with member organisations participating by paying
    a fee ranging from US$1,000 to US$77,000, depending on the type of
    organisation, its revenue and location. Individuals can also apply using
    the same application process as organisations. While W3C membership is
    limited to organisations who pay a fee, participation in W3C groups varies.
    For many groups that are typically made up of dues-paying organisational
    members, individuals can be invited to participate without a fee.</p>
