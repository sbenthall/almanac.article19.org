    <h1 class="title">3rd Generation Partnership Project |&nbsp;3GPP</h1>
    <p>3GPP is a membership-based organisation that unites various national and
    regional standard development organisations for mobile telecommunications.
    Participants that are representatives of big telecommunication companies
    such as Verizon, Vodafone, China Mobile, and América Móvil can become
    individual members through their national and regional SDOs. Their scope of
    work includes cellular telecommunications technologies including radio
    access, core network and services; as well as non-radio access to the core
    network and interworking with non-3GPP networks. 3GPP standards are
    contribution-driven by organisational and individual partners in working
    groups and at the technical specification group level.
