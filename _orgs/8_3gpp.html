    <h1 class="title">3rd Generation Partnership Project |&nbsp;3GPP</h1>
    <p> 3GPP develops specifications for cellular telecommunication
    technologies. It is a membership-based organisation that represents a
    partnership of seven national and regional telecommunication SDOs.
    Participants that are representatives of big telecommunication companies
    such as Verizon, Vodafone, China Mobile, and América Móvil can become
    individual members through their national and regional SDOs. The 3GPP’s
    scope of work addresses elements such as radio access, core network and
    services, and inter-networking with non-3GPP networks. 3GPP standards are
    driven by contributions made by organisational and individual partners in
    working groups and technical specification groups.  </p>
