    <p>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) develops a
    large range of international standards for modern telecommunications
    hardware, such as standards for networks that allow devices to connect to
    the internet, including Ethernet, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. IEEE also works on
    standards for robotics, smart cities, and artificial intelligence. While
    anyone can <a
    href="https://www.ieee.org/membership/join/index.html">join</a> a
    working group and contribute to building standards, the organisation
    structure is complicated â€“ finding public information about the working
    groups can be challenging and civil society participants need to be
    accepted by working group chairs to begin participation.</p>
