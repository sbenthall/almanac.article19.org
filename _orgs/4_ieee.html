    <h1 class="title">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers |&nbsp;IEEE</h1>
    <p>The IEEE develops a wide range of international standards for modern
    telecommunication hardware, including standards for networks that allow
    devices to connect to the internet, such as Ethernet, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.
    IEEE also works on standards for robotics, smart cities, and artificial
    intelligence. While you can follow IEEE working groups as an observer, you
    must be a member to actively contribute to building standards. Individuals
    can become either student or professional members by paying annual dues.
    However, even for members, finding information can be challenging.
    Moreover, certain working groups may require advanced corporate membership
    or approval from the chairs to join, even as an observer.
