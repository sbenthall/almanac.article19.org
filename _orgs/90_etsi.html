    <p>ETSI is a standards developing organisation responsible for developing
    standards related to telecommunications, broadcasting and other electronic
    communications networks and services. It only accepts organisations as
    members (individual contributors must be affiliated with and representing a
    member organisation). Set up in response to proposals from the European
    Commission, ETSI is officially recognised as a European Standards
    Organisation to develop ICT standards and support for European regulations
    and legislations through the development of Harmonised European Standards.
    If a manufacturer wants to enter its product into the EU Single Market, it
    must comply with certain minimal safety and procedural requirements, known
    as a harmonised standard. It is also a regional partner organisation of the
    3GPP. Non-profit organisations can apply to become a member of ETSI by
    paying an annual â‚¬2000 fee.  </p>
