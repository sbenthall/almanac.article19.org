    <p>
    ETSI is a European organisation responsible for developing standards
    related to telecommunications, broadcasting, and other electronic
    communication networks and services. It only accepts organisations as
    members, and individual contributors must be affiliated with and represent
    a member organisation.  ETSI is officially recognised as a European
    Standards Organization (ESO). As such, it has a mandate to develop ICT
    standards and support for European regulations and legislation through the
    development of Harmonised European Standards. If a manufacturer wants to
    enter its product into the EU Single Market, it must comply with certain
    minimum safety and procedural requirements set in Harmonised European
    Standards. ETSI is also a regional partner organisation of the <a href="{{ site.url }}/orgs/8_3gpp.html">3GPP</a>.
    Non-profit organisations can apply to become a member of ETSI by paying an
    annual â‚¬2000 fee.
