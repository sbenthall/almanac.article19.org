        <p>This research group aims to research use cases, requirements, and
        best practices to decentralise core internet infrastructure and related
        protocols, such as the <a
        href="https://www.icann.org/rdap">Registration Data Access Protocol
        (RDAP)</a>. RDAP allows users to access the current registration data of
        websites in a secure manner that encrypts the data between the server and a
        client. Internet registrars are mandated by ICANN to implement RDAP. With
        internet infrastructure services – such as web hosting providers and content
        delivery networks – becoming more centralised among a smaller number of
        companies, the entire network becomes dependent on a single point of failure,
        risking dozens of websites going down simultaneously and limiting access to
        information. Decentralised networks can bypass censorship as peers interact
        directly rather than through centralised infrastructure providers that control
        information flows.
