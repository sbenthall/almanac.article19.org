        <p>This research group aims to research the development of path
        awareness within the transport and application layers, whereby
        <a
        href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/security/glossary/what-is-endpoint/"
        class="glossary">endpoints</a> can discover the properties of
        various data paths, and select data paths for the exchange of data and
        information. Currently, endpoints in IP-based networks have little
        information about the data paths in which their traffic is carried, nor
        have control about the data path beyond reaching their destination
        address. In the best case, endpoints can potentially select data paths
        that are more trusted and less vulnerable to snooping and monitoring
        from malicious actors, protecting the privacy and security of data.
        However, this may simply be unactionable information from the clientâ€™s
        perspective in many cases.</p>
