    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>This working group was responsible for defining the first IETF-standardised encrypted DNS transport <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-tls/" class="glossary">(DNS over TLS)</a>, as used between DNS clients and recursive resolvers. Its current focus defines steps to prevent pervasive monitoring during exchanges between DNS servers in an attempt to limit the amount of data leakage that happens during multi-hop DNS resolution. A large amount of information, including the domain name, request type and response, is shared between servers when making a DNS request to a server. Data leakage can lead to monitoring of users or blocking of information being requested. Encrypting DNS exchanges can prevent possible monitoring and blocking and filtering of websites from occurring.</p>
