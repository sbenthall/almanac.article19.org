        <p>This working group aims to standardise a mechanism that will improve
        the <a
        href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/bots/how-captchas-work/"
        class="glossary">CAPTCHA</a> model to increase user privacy.
        CAPTCHAs are used to distinguish between humans and computers to
        prevent bots from sending repeated requests in DDoS attacks or engaging
        in other malicious activities. In the current common use case, after
        completing a CAPTCHA, a cookie is stored on the client application to
        show a server that the client has been verified for future purposes.
        However, this allows for the server to link together all the user’s
        connections that have required authorisation, giving the server the
        ability to monitor a user’s browsing history and behaviour and even
        identify the user. This new mechanism could offer a significant
        opportunity for any site that currently uses CAPTCHA to enhance the
        anonymity available to its user base. For this to be implemented,
        however, web browsers must be willing to accept PrivacyPass tokens from
        a small number of issuers.</p>
