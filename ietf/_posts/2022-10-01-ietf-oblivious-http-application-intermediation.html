        <p>This working group aims to define a protocol to <a
        href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/http-requests"
        class="glossary">anonymise HTTP</a> requests using a partly-trusted
        intermediary. HTTP requests can reveal information about the client to
        a server. Over time, servers are able to use this information to
        assemble profiles of the clientâ€™s behaviour, and make inferences about
        real people using these clients. One widely-anticipated use of OHAI is
        a way to mask DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) queries, making it difficult for
        anyone to aggregate information about specific DNS requests made from
        any given client. This can provide a degree of protection against
        servers correlating requests and increase user privacy.</p>
