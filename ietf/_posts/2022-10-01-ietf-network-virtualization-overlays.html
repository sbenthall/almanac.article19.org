        <p>This working group develops protocols that support <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-network-virtualization" class="glossary">network virtualisation</a> which operate over an IP underlay transport network within a data centre environment. Increasing demand from applications for computation, data storage, and network resources requires increased scalability, often in the form of server and network virtualisation, of workload agility and flexibility for adding, moving, and connecting services. As such, a virtual network must be able to communicate explicitly within itself as well as beyond it. Given the fact that many virtual networks are often hosted in one data centre, a high level of security and privacy is required to prevent the traffic of one network being exposed to another. Leakage of data can lead to personally identifiable information being exposed, which can be used to track users associated with a particular network.</p>

        <li><b>Current drafts:</b> <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-encap/">Network Virtualization Overlays (NVO3) Encapsulation Considerations</a> aims to be an informational document on the considerations made by the nvo3 design team to encapsulate layer 2 traffic in packets to be transported over layer 3. These considerations will address issues such as corruption in the Virtual Network Identifier (VNI), which would lead to leakage of data or attackers attempting to inject packets with spoofed VNIs, leading users to malware.</li>
