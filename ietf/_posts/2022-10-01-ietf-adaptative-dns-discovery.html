    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>This working group was responsible for defining the first
        IETF-standardized encrypted DNS transport (DNS over TLS). Its current
        focus on the link between <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/domain-name-system-dns-resolvers-work-76639.html" class="glossary">DNS resolvers</a> aims to limit the amount of
        data leakage that happens during multi-hop DNS resolution. It also
        defines the mechanisms through which a DNS resolver’s information is
        communicated, allowing the client to decide which DNS server to use.
        Sending DNS messages over encrypted transports to DNS resolvers can
        prevent malicious actors from snooping and reading the contents of DNS
        messages, and modify DNS traffic to block responses from selective
        queries. This can prevent internet service providers or government
        actors from monitoring users who access sensitive websites, or from
        blocking specific sites.</p>
