        <p>This working group aims to develop protocols to enable a <a
        href="https://www.metaswitch.com/knowledge-center/reference/what-is-path-computation-element-pce"
        class="glossary">Path Computation Element (PCE)</a>-based network
        to allow for network nodes to determine and find a suitable data path
        to send information from the source to the destination. By having
        access to topology information of an entire network, the PCE can select
        a routing path that is efficient, improves traffic performance, and is
        adaptive to network changes. By factoring in security considerations,
        PCE can also potentially select a data path that is more secure and
        less vulnerable to monitoring from malicious actors, protecting user
        privacy and security. However, this can only work if the client is in a
        position to make a decision about how to use it in an empowering way.
        In the worst-case scenario, descriptions of path-based constraints can
        facilitate or legitimise overreaching demands for information from
        intermediary network operators.</p>
