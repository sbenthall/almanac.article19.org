        <p>This working group focuses on the maintenance and evolution of the
        encrypted transport protocol <a
        href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-road-to-quic/"
        class="glossary">QUIC</a>, supporting its implementation and
        developing possible extensions to it. Created initially by Google and
        growing in usage, QUIC is designed to combine cryptographic protections
        with transport protocols, folding security and transport into the same
        mechanism. Despite this robustness, the deployment model for QUIC has
        long been that if it fails, systems that prefer to use QUIC will
        instead fall back to TLS-over-TCP. This means that a malicious network
        operator who objects to the metadata-hiding enabled by QUIC can simply
        block it and clients will return to the metadata leakage of the earlier
        default protocols. This can lead to eavesdropping into the information
        being sent, and ultimately determining which websites users are
        visiting.</p>
