        <p>This working group aims to improve the applicability and suitability
        of the TLS family of protocols for use in emerging protocols and use
        cases. These protocols are widely relied on to implement cryptography
        on the web and provide secure communication over a network, including
        in the QUIC protocol. The group is also looking to encrypt the
        ClientHello <a
        href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/"
        class="glossary">Server Name Indication (SNI)</a>, which the client
        uses to declare at the beginning of the TLS handshake what service
        (such as a website) the user is requesting in order for the server to
        decide which certificate to present. SNI, however, makes it possible
        for censors or filters to block users from accessing sensitive
        websites.</p>
