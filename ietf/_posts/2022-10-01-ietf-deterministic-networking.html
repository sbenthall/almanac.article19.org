    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>This working group develops routing and signalling protocols for
        deterministic networks under single administrative control.
        Deterministic networks are networks with features designed to provide
        explicit guarantees about message deliverability, hence increasing
        reliability and potentially guaranteeing low latency and zero data
        loss. With technologies and services such as video and audio streaming
        and real-time communications requiring real-time responses,
        deterministic networks aim to establish data flows that improve the
        quality of service and reduce any potential lag in the connection. Most
        feasible deterministic network deployments depend on single or
        closed-group administrative control over the network, so they are not
        relevant for Internet-spanning communications. Rather, this makes it
        possible for, for example, a large network operator to ensure that they
        meet a particular service level agreement for clients that use their
        network exclusively. There is an implication here that a client using
        such a network is willing to trust the network operator to provide
        these guarantees as these networks can potentially increase or reduce
        the risks to snooping and monitoring, and in turn the client's privacy
        and anonymity from being compromised.</p>
