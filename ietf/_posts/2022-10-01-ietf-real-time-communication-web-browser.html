    <div class="wg-description">
        <p>This working group standardises mechanisms that allow for the
        transmission of real-time audio, video, and collaboration between
        browsers. WebRTC sessions can be used to extract audio or video data
        from the browser if the user doesnâ€™t understand the
        permissions-granting process. Real-time data streams can promote
        linkable, persistent identification of otherwise anonymous clients.
        Also, conferencing sessions which appear to be encrypted to the user
        may not be end-to-end encrypted, allowing the site operator to snoop on
        or record communications between unsuspecting parties. Privacy and
        security concerns need to be addressed so users can safely communicate
        with each other.</p>
