        <p>This working group aims to develop protocols that collect data and
        information at the application layer for measurement purposes while
        also protecting an individual’s privacy. Researchers and companies may
        require measurements to determine trends within a large population
        sample, such as how many websites fail to render, or how many
        applications fail to respond. Some of the information in the report
        sent to the entity, such as IP addresses, is personally identifiable
        and can be used to track individuals. New cryptographic techniques
        where multiple servers compute aggregated statistics without learning a
        set of measurements may prevent attackers from connecting the
        measurements to an individual. One of the working group's contentions
        relates to the balance between a  proposed protocol's reliance on
        cryptographic mechanisms, interactions of non-colluding parties, and
        policies of individual actors. This leads to questions such as how
        precise the aggregated measurements would be.
